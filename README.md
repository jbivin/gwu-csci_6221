## Statistical Analysis in R

Before starting, the user should have both R and RStudio installed:
R is available from: https://www.r-project.org/
RStudio is available from: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

The user will need the following files:
GUI.R
Random_Forest.R
training.csv

**First**: The user should adjust the file path in Random_Forest.R so that it can find training.csv ( getwd() returns the working directory, and can help here). The user should also adjust the file path in GUI.R to find the Random_Forest.R file

**Second**: The user must run Random_Forest.R (ctr+shift+enter helps) to place 'rf' in the global environment and train the model

**Third**: The user should run (ctrl+shift+enter) GUI.R. An application titled "Patent Grants Predictor" will open

**Fourth**: The user should adjust the input values to reflect metrics for the community in question and the desired timeframe for the prediction

**Fifth**: The user should press the 'Plot' button in the lower right

**Sixth**: The user should switch to the Patent Projections page to view the projection

That should be enough to get you started.

Enjoy!
